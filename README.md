# 🧠 Age Estimation from Facial Images using CNNs

Predicting human age 👤📸 from facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet50).  
💡 A deep learning project with real-world use cases in demographics, retail marketing, and customer profiling.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This model predicts a person's **real age** from their face photo using a fine-tuned **ResNet50** architecture.  
Includes:

- 🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🧠 Model training using TensorFlow/Keras  
- 📈 Evaluation on test data (MAE ≈ **6.08 years**)  
- 💾 Model saving (`.h5`) for real deployment

## 🧪 Results & Metrics

- ✅ Final **MAE** on validation: **~6.08 years**
- 🧠 Trained for 20 epochs
- 🎯 Works well on younger age ranges (where data was richer)

---

## 💼 Use Cases

- 🛒 **Retail**: Personalizing ads based on estimated age
- 🧪 **Research**: Age trend analysis in demographic studies
- 🔒 **Access Control**: Age filtering for restricted content or sales
- 🎥 **Surveillance**: Crowd profiling in real-time systems

## 🛠 How to Run Locally

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib seaborn

# Run the notebook
Open age_prediction_resnet50.ipynb and run all cells.

📈 Next Improvements
Use EfficientNet or MobileNet for better performance with fewer resources

Add interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Gradio)

Handle underrepresented ages using data augmentation techniques
